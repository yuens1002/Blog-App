02.28.15

for this week.  i have successfully added all the functionalities to the site and themed the site with bootstrap.  it’s up on my github page (you're looking at it right).  Still to do, add content to reflect course work on the page, further theme development, and host it on digitalocean entirely by installing duplicating the stack, migrate the database, install apache, and modify mod_Wigi  

The live site is currently being hosted by pythonAnywhere:
