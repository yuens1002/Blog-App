# wats 1030 - final project 
###Blog App Deployment Based on Django Framework

at this pt for the final project, i’m simply doing a python/django deployment with a custom domain blog site which will allow an authenticated user to add and edit post(s).  This deployment blog app is based on the tutorial here

http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/whats_next/index.html

02.28.15

for this week.  i have successfully added all the functionalities to the site and themed the site with bootstrap.  it’s up on github and version controled by git.  To do still, I'll need to figure out how to host the dulicate the deployment on digitalocean to actually host it with apache / mod_wigi then edit my dns settings to host it under my own custom domain.  i'd like to augment the content of the app to reflect this course. 

The live site is currently being hosted by pythonAnywhere:

###IMPORTANT


To Add/Edit a post, you'll need to login as John/thi$i$Cool (both username and password are case censitive), then click on the view site link at the top in the blue nav area.  you'll see an added + sign at the top of right corner of the site and when you click on a post there, you'll see an edit button next to the date to allow you to edit the post.
