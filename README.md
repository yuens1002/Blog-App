# wats 1030 - final project 
###Blog App Deployment Based on Django Framework

at this pt for the final project, i’m simply doing a python/django deployment with a custom domain blog site which will allow an authenticated user to add and edit post(s).  This excerise is based on the tutorial given here

https://www.gitbook.com/book/djangogirls/djangogirls-tutorial/details

02.28.15

for this week.  i have successfully added all the functionalities to the site and themed the site with bootstrap.  it’s up on my github page (you're looking at it right).  Still to do, add content to reflect course work on the page, further theme development, and host it on digitalocean entirely by installing duplicating the stack, migrate the database, install apache, and modify mod_Wigi  

The live site is currently being hosted by pythonAnywhere:

###IMPORTANT

To Add/Edit a post, you'll need to login as John/thi$i$Cool (both username and password are case censitive), then click on the view site link at the top in the blue nav area.  you'll see an added + sign at the top of right corner of the site and when you click on a post there, you'll see an edit button next to the date to allow you to edit the post.
